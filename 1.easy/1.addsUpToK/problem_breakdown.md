# Explanation of the Solution ```javascript function addsUpToK(numbers, k)

### Explanation of the Solution

```JavaScript
function addsUpToK(numbers, k) {
    if(numbers == null || numbers.length == 0) {
        return false
    }

    const seen = new Set();

    for (const number of numbers) {
        if(seen.has(k - number)) {
            console.log(number, k - number)
            return true
        }
        seen.add(number)
    }

    return false
}
```

### How It Works
Input Check:
The function first checks if the numbers array is null or empty. If so, it returns false because there are no numbers to check.

Set Initialization:
It creates a new set called seen, which will store numbers as we iterate through numbers.

Iterating through Numbers:
For each number in numbers:

It checks if (k - number) exists in the seen set. If it does, it means there is a previously seen number such that number + (k - number) == k.
This means two numbers add up to k, so it prints the pair and returns true.
If not, it adds number to seen and continues.
If No Pair Found:
If the loop completes without finding such a pair, it returns false.

###  Why Use a Set Instead of Nested Loops?
Efficiency:
A naive solution checks every possible pair, resulting in O(nÂ²) time complexity.
This solution uses a set for O(1) lookups, reducing the overall complexity to O(n).
One Pass:
You only iterate through the array once, and at each step, you instantly know if the complement exists among previously seen numbers.
How to Educate Yourself to Come Up With This Approach

1. Understand Classic Problems and Patterns
This is a classic example of the "Two Sum" problem.
Many coding problems have underlying patterns like:
- Hashing for fast lookups
- Two pointers
- Sorting and scanning

2. Learn About Data Structures
Sets and hash maps enable O(1) lookups.
Learning when and why to use these data structures is key.

3. Practice Pattern Recognition
As you solve more problems, you'll notice that:
When you need to check for the existence of a complement/subtraction result, a set or map often helps.

4. Study Problem Solutions
Read high-quality explanations on platforms like LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks, or books like Cracking the Coding Interview.
Try to understand why a particular data structure or algorithm improves efficiency.

5. Experiment and Compare Approaches
Implement both the naive and optimized approaches.
Compare their performance on large inputs to see the difference.

6. Ask "Can I remember what I've seen so far?"
For many "find a pair" or "find a sum" problems, consider:
"If I've seen a value, can it help me answer the question about the current value?"
This leads naturally to using a set/map to remember "what I've seen so far."
