Problem Restatement
•	Two hubs: Alpha and Beta.
•	Shuttles go Alpha → Beta and Beta → Alpha.
•	Each trip takes 100 time units.
•	Departure times are fixed and given in sorted arrays:
•	alpha2beta[] → departures from Alpha.
•	beta2alpha[] → departures from Beta.
•	You need to complete missions.
•	One mission = Alpha → Beta → Alpha (a round trip).
•	Always take the earliest possible shuttle at each step.
•	Task: Return the time when all missions are completed.

⸻

Key Constraints
•	You start at time 0 in Alpha.
•	Always wait for the next available shuttle (cannot take one that already departed).
•	Guaranteed that all missions are possible.
•	Complexity hint:
O\big(trips \times (\text{len(alpha2beta)} \times \max(alpha2beta) + \text{len(beta2alpha)} \times \max(beta2alpha))\big)
is fine.

Example from image
•	alpha2beta = [0, 200, 500]
•	beta2alpha = [99, 210, 450]
•	missions = 1

Step-by-step:
1.	Start at Alpha, time = 0.
Earliest alpha2beta you can take = 0.
Arrive at Beta, time = 0 + 100 = 100.
2.	Now at Beta, time = 100.
Earliest beta2alpha ≥ 100 = 210.
Depart at 210, arrive at Alpha at 310.

✅ Done. Output = 310.

Do you want me to sketch the algorithm (step by step logic) for how to solve this in general, or do you prefer a Java implementation straight away?
