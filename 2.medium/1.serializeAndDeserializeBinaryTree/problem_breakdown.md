# What is a Binary Tree?

A **binary tree** is a data structure made up of nodes, where each node has at most two children: a **left** child and a **right** child.

---

## Key Features

- **Root**: The top node of the tree.
- **Node**: Each element in the tree; stores a value and links to its children.
- **Child**: A node connected below another node.
- **Leaf**: A node with no children.
- **Subtree**: Any node and all its descendants.

## Visualization

```
      A
     / \
    B   C
   / \
  D   E
```

- `A` is the root.
- `B` and `C` are children of `A`.
- `D` and `E` are children of `B`.
- `D`, `E`, and `C` are leaves.

## Types

- **Full binary tree**: Every node has 0 or 2 children.
- **Complete binary tree**: All levels are filled except possibly the last, which is filled from left to right.
- **Perfect binary tree**: All internal nodes have two children and all leaves are at the same level.

**In summary:**  
A binary tree is a way to organize data with each item connected to at most two others, forming a branching structure perfect for certain kinds of storage, searching, and hierarchical relationships.
